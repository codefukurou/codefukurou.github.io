# Tutoring
Both education and learning facilitation have been a significant part of my life and a strong passion of mine for the past five years. I started running private tutoring sessions for Mathematics, English and Japanese during the end of my high school years for those in younger years. This continued into university before I decided I needed a change of pace (and an income on the holidays) and become a barista. I continued my passion as a volunteer peer learning facilitator (PLF) for the STIMulate program (now under the Student Success Group) at QUT (you can read more about it here), of which I am now a senior PLF and student executive member. At the start of 2018 I become a sessional academic at QUT, demonstrating practical sessions for EGB111 (Foundations of Engineering Design) and wish to continue and expand my role as a sessional academic in the coming years.

I currently offer private tutoring sessions for QUT students studying any of the following subjects:

* MXB100 - Introductory Calculus and Algebra
* MXB101 - Probability and Stochastic Modelling 1
* MXB103 - Introductory Computational Mathematics
* MXB105 - Calculus of One and Two Variables
* MXB106 - Linear Algebra and Differential Equations
* MXB107 - Introduction to Statistical Modelling
* MZB125 - Introductory Engineering Mathematics
* MZB126 - Engineering Computation
* EGB100 - Engineering Sustainability and Professional Practice
* EGB111 - Foundations of Engineering Design
* EGB113 - Energy in Engineering Systems
* EGB120 - Foundations of Electrical Engineering
* EGB121 - Engineering Mechanics
* EGB240 - Electronic Design
* EGB242 - Signal Analysis
* EGB403 - Systems Programming
* CAB201 - Programming Principles
* CAB202 - Microprocessors and Digital Systems
